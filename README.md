# CARL Air Brake Motherboard Software

This repository contains the software for the motherboard of the [CARL Air Brake][cab-repo] computer. The CARL Air Brake computer
automatically controls a rocket air brake in flight, so that the vehicle attains an apogee at the desired altitude. Its motherboard (a
Raspberry Pi 3 Model A+) runs the main flight software for the autonomous air brake.

**NOTE**: *The documentation for this repository is currently in progress. When complete, this README will be updated and all documentation
will be available here.*
